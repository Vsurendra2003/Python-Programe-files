Exercise 1: Create a function in Python
Write a program to create a function that takes two arguments, name and age, and print their value.


Answer

def demo(name, age):
    print(name, age)
demo("Ben", 25)


Exercise 2: Create a function with variable length of arguments
Write a program to create function func1() to accept a variable length of arguments and print their value.

Function call:
# call function with 3 arguments
func1(20, 40, 60)

# call function with 2 arguments
func1(80, 100)

Answer


def func1(*args):
    for i in args:
        print(i)

func1(20, 40, 60)
func1(80, 100)


Exercise 3: Return multiple values from a function
Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction. Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.

Given:

def calculation(a, b):
    # Your Code

res = calculation(40, 10)
print(res)

Answer

def calculation(a, b):
    addition = a + b
    subtraction = a - b
    return addition, subtraction
res = calculation(40, 10)
print(res)


Exercise 4: Create a function with a default argument
Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.

It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both.
If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary

Given:

showEmployee("Ben", 12000)
showEmployee("Jessa")

Answer

def show_employee(name, salary=9000):
    print("Name:", name, "salary:", salary)
show_employee("Ben", 12000)
show_employee("Jessa")

Exercise 5: Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way

Create an outer function that will accept two parameters, a and b
Create an inner function inside an outer function that will calculate the addition of a and b
At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it

Answer

def outer_fun(a, b):
    square = a ** 2
    def addition(a, b):
        return a + b
    add = addition(a, b)
    return add + 5
result = outer_fun(5, 10)
print(result)


Exercise 6: Create a recursive function
Write a program to create a recursive function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 10.

A recursive function is a function that calls itself again and again.

Answer

def addition(num):
    if num:
        return num + addition(num - 1)
    else:
        return 0
res = addition(10)
print(res)


Exercise 7: Assign a different name to function and call it through the new name
Below is the function display_student(name, age). Assign a new name show_tudent(name, age) to it and call it using the new name.

Given:

def display_student(name, age):
    print(name, age)

display_student("Emma", 26)


Answer


def display_student(name, age):
    print(name, age)
display_student("Emma", 26)
showStudent = display_student
showStudent("Emma", 26)
