Exercise 5: Display numbers from a list using loop
Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

The number must be divisible by five
If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

Given:

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

answer

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for item in numbers:
    if item > 500:
        break
    if item <= 150 and item % 5 == 0:
        print(item)

Exercise 6: Count the total number of digits in a number
Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop.

For example, the number is 75869, so the output should be 5.

    for j in range(k-i,0,-1):
        print(j,end=' ')
    print()

Exercise 8: Print list in reverse order using a loop

Exercise 10: Use else block to display a message “Done” after successful execution of for loop
For example, the following loop will execute without any error.

Given:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

Answer

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Done!")
 

Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

Examples:

6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2×3 = 6
37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
Given:

# range
start = 25
end = 50


Answer

start = 25
end = 50
print("Prime numbers between", start, "and", end, "are:")
for num in range(start, end + 1):
    if num > 1:
        for i in range(2, num):
            if (num % i) == 0:
                break
        else:
            print(num)


Exercise 12: Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series above is 13+21 = 34.


Answer
num1, num2 = 0, 1
print("Fibonacci sequence:")
for _ in range(10):
    print(num1, end="  ")
    num1, num2 = num2, num1 + num2



Exercise 13: Find the factorial of a given number
Write a program to use the loop to find the factorial of a given number.

The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.

For example: calculate the factorial of 5

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

Answer

import math
num = 5
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
else:
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {math.factorial(num)}")


Exercise 14: Reverse a given integer number

Given:76542

Answer  

num = 76542
reverse_number = 0
print("Given Number ", num)
while num > 0:
    reminder = num % 10
    reverse_number = (reverse_number * 10) + reminder
    num = num // 10
print("Revere Number ", reverse_number) 


Exercise 15: Use a loop to display elements from a given list present at odd index positions

Given:

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]


Answer

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
for i in my_list[1::2]:
    print(i, end=" ")   


Exercise 16: Calculate the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Write a program to rint the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number

Given:input_number = 6

Answer

input_number = 6
for i in range(1, input_number + 1):
    print("Current Number is :", i, " and the cube is", (i * i * i))


Exercise 17: Find the sum of the series upto n terms
Write a program to calculate the sum of series up to n term. For example, if n =5 the series will become 2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 = 24690

Given:

# number of terms
n = 5

Answer  

n = 5
start = 2
sum_seq = 0
for i in range(0, n):
    print(start, end="+")
    sum_seq += start
    start = start * 10 + 2
print("\nSum of above series is:", sum_seq) 


Exercise 18: Print the following pattern
Write a program to print the following start pattern using the for loop

Answer
    
rows = 5
for i in range(rows):
    print("* " * (i + 1))
for i in range(rows - 1, 0, -1):
    print("* " * i)
